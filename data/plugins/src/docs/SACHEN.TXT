Mapper info by The Mad Dumper

This mapper has been assigned the designation UNL-Sachen-74LS374N for 
the UNIF format. If you must use ines, use mapper #243.  (that's 243 decimal)

The hardware:

THIS is interesting.  The board has 2 64K EPROMs and a "74LS374N" chip.
The "LS374" is really a custom mapper chip, and is not the more well known
74LS374 octal latch.  


-

This cart is sorta similar to the MMC3.  There are two registers, and you
write a control word first, followed by a data byte.

-

The cart uses 4100h for the control register, and 4101h for the data
register.

Only A0, A8, A14, and A15 are used in address decoding, so anything in the
range of 4100h-41FFh, 4300h-43FFh, ... , 7F00h-7FFFh will access the
registers.
