Mapper info by The Mad Dumper
---


This mapper has been assigned the designation BMC-16in1A for the UNIF 
format.  If you must use ines, use mapper #53.  (that's 53 decimal)

Hmm, what an odd multicart.  It has 16 128K UNROM titles on it.  Stuff like
Rygar and Ghosts & Goblins.  There are 4 512K ROMs, and a single 32K EPROM
on it!


---


The hardware:

It consists of 4 512K ROMs, 1 32K EPROM, 74174, 74161, 7432, PAL, and an
8K VRAM.  Not much more to it.


-

The cart has two registers.  The Bank Select Register at 6000h-7FFFh and 
the Mapper Control / Game Select Register at 8000h to FFFFh.  There are 
no bus conflicts.


-

Bank Select Register:

7  bit  0
---------
xxxx xBBB

Writing to 8000h-FFFFh sets this register.  It is used to select a 16K
ROM bank which will appear at 8000h-BFFFh.  The state of this register on
powerup is unknown.


-

Mapper Control / Game Select Register

7  bit  0
---------
xxML GGGG


This is written to by writing anywhere at 6000h-7FFFh.

M:
0 - Horizontal Mirroring
1 - Vertical Mirroring

L:
0 - Use the menu ROM, allow this register to be written to.
    Note that ONLY the 32K "menu ROM" (UNIF ID: PRG4)
    can be accessed at 8000h-FFFFh.  The 2Mbytes of "Game ROMs"
    (UNIF ID's PRG0-PRG3) can be partially read at 6000h-7FFFh (see below).

1 - Lock.  This will lock further changes to 6000h, and will disable the
    menu ROM.  The "Game ROMs" are then enabled and can appear in 8000h-FFFFh.

G:  These are the "Game Select" bits, and select which 128K page of the
    game ROMs will be used.  Only 1 128K game ROM page can be accessed at a
    time.  To access another, you must reset the console.

How to work it good.

On startup, the Mapper Control / Game Select Register is cleared.  This
switches the menu ROM in (UNIF ID: PRG4), sets horiz. mirroring, and disables
the "lock".

This mapper can be thought of as two cascaded mappers, like alot of the other
multicarts use.  This time, the "base mapper" is UNROM (ines mapper #2).  
Each game is 128K in size, so 16 128K games = 2Mbytes worth of "Game ROMs".  
These are seperate from the "Menu ROM" which is 32K in size.

The Menu ROM has UNIF ID PRG4, while the 4 512K game ROMs have the UNIF
ID's PRG0 thru PRG3.  You can treat the 4 512K ROMs as a single 2Mbyte block.

Since this thing has an underlying UNROM, it behaves as such on the 128K
game banks.  The upper half of PRG space, C000-FFFFh, is fixed to the last
16K of the 128K bank, while the first half is movable.  Writing to 8000h-
FFFFh selects the desired bank.  D0-D2 are used.

-

On startup, the 2Mbyte PRG ROMs are swapped out and the 32K Menu ROM is
switched into 8000h-FFFFh.  Reading 6000h-7FFFh will allow you to read the
LAST 8K of the selected 128K bank.  This allows the menu code to tell which 
games are on the cart.

Writing to the LOCK bit swap out the menu code and allow the game data to
appear at 8000h-FFFFh, and for the UNROM mapping to take over.  The game code
writes this to RAM:

0500: STX 06000h
0503: JMP (0FFFCh)

You can select any desired 128K bank with the lock bit 0, however you can
only read the last 8K of it through 6000h-7FFFh.  Setting the lock bit to 1
will prevent further writes to 6000h-7FFFh, and will swap in the selected
bank to 8000h-FFFFh.  

Mirroring is of course locked as well as the selected bank when the lock bit
it set to 1.

That's it.  Have fun!
