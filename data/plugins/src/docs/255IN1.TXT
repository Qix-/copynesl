             255 in 1 Multicart, Mapper: BMC-HelloKitty255in1

Mapper info by The Mad Dumper
---


This mapper has been assigned the designation BMC-HelloKitty255in1 for 
the UNIF format.  If you must use ines, use mapper #63 (that's 63 decimal).

This multi was somewhat odd.  It has a picture of Hello Kitty on it, and
not much else.  No text or anything else to speak of.

The hardware:

2 74174's, 7408, 7432, 74139, 74153, 3 1Mbyte ROMs, 8K VRAM.


-

Like alot of other multicarts, this one uses the address written to to select
the desired banks and other things.

-

Bank Select Register:


It uses A1 through A7.  This means the address written to matters, while
the actual data written does not.

1xxx FRBB PPPP PVSM

P: Select a 32K PRG ROM bank in the currently selected 1Mbyte ROM bank.

S: PRG ROM bank size.  

1 selects 32K mode
0 selects 16K mode

V: PRG ROM 16K bank.

0 selects the lower 16K, and 1 selects the upper 16K.

When in 32K mode, this bit is not used.

B: Selects which ROM to use.  Only roms 0,1, and 2 are supported.

This selects which 1Mbyte bank will be used.

F: "force bank" enable.

0 - disable bank forcing
1 - enable bank forcing

This is sorta odd.  When bank forcing is on, the last *8K* of the PRG
space is switched over to ROM 0.  The 32K PRG ROM bank does not
change.  I believe this was done to allow loading of graphics data into
VRAM without having to swap all the PRG ROM out.  

R: VRAM write control. 

0 - enable writing to VRAM
1 - disable writing to VRAM

M: Mirroring.  T

0 is V mirroring
1 is H mirroring


That's it.
