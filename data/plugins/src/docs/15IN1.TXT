Mapper info by The Mad Dumper

This mapper has been assigned the designation BMC-Generic15in1 for the UNIF 
format.  iNES format on new dumps is no longer supported.

Whee, another multi.  About as generic as they come.

The hardware:

3 128K ROMs, 74161, 74257, 7402, 7432, and 8 330 ohm resistors.

-

This multi so far is unique.  It has those resistors on there which
isolate the ROM from the data bus when the bank address is written to.
So, the byte that is in the ROM at the written to address is actually loaded
into the bank select register, rather than the byte written!


-

Bank Select Register:


It uses D0-D3 of the ROM contents.

bit:
3210
----
BBBB

The 4 bits directly select an 8K CHR ROM page from the CHR ROM.

The PRG switching is really, really weird.

-

If the bank is 00h or 01h:

In this case, the first 32K is selected.  

-

If the bank is anything else:

The first 16K of the PRG space is fixed to the LAST 16K of the PRG ROM.
The last 16K is selected via the bank bits.

-

Mirroring is fixed to vertical.

That's it.
