This mapper has been assigned the designation BMC-NovelDiamond9999999in1 
for the UNIF format.  If you must use ines, use mapper #54.  (that's 
54 decimal)


This is your basic stupid multicart.  It has 4 or 5 REAL games on it and
a silly seeded random # generator thing to make the listing.  The menu
has fucking *The Lion King* graphics and music, too! I mean, WTF?

The hardware:

1 gloptopped 128K PRG ROM, 1 gloptopped 64K CHR ROM.  One glopped 74LS161.


-

The cart has a single register.  Write anywhere in 8000h-FFFFh.  A0-2 are
used.


-

Bank Select Register:


It uses A0, A1, and A2.  This means the address written to matters, while
the actual data written does not.  

PRG ROM is broken up into 4 32K banks.  A0 and A1 control the bank.
A0 = LSB, A1 = MSB.

CHR ROM is broken up into 8 8K banks.  A0,A1, and A2 control the bank.
A0 = LSB. A2 = MSB.


That's it.
