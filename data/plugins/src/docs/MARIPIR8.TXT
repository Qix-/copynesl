bastard hacks to it.


What a weird cart.  It is normal old SMB1, but with lots of hacks and such.
Here's what the back of the cart says:

NCN-35 STRONG CARTRIDGE. FLYING MALEE. "MALEE 2"

1. To select stage: Press "B" button directly after turn on machine.
2. To fly malee: Press "Select" button at all time.
3. Press: "A,B,R,U,L,D,B,A" buttons in order.
   To become hero: press "START" button again.
   To change music: press "R" button again.
   To stop music: press "L" button again.
   To increase enemy speed: press "U" button again.

There are still 1-UPs and more secret technics left.

The hardware:

A 32K PRG ROM, 2 more K of ROM, 2K of WRAM, and 8K of CHR ROM.

The 2K ROM (P1) is mapped in at 6000h-6FFFh
The 2K RAM is mapped in at 7000h-7FFFh
The 32K ROM (P0) is mapped in at 8000h-FFFFh
and the 8K CHR ROM is mapped into PPU space like normal.

That's it.  There is no banking involved.
