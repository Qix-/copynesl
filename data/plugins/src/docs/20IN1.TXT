Mapper info by The Mad Dumper
---


This mapper has been assigned the designation BMC-Generic20in1 for the UNIF 
format.  If you must use ines, use mapper #231.  (that's 231 decimal)


Another multicart.

The hardware:


2 74161's, a 7400, 8K SRAM for VRAM, and a 512K PRG ROM.

-

Like alot of other multicarts, this one uses the address written to to select
the desired banks and other things.

-

Bank Select Register:


It uses A1 through A7.  This means the address written to matters, while
the actual data written does not.  

15      addr      0
-------------------
1xxx xxxx MMSP PPPx

P: Select a 32K PRG ROM bank

S: PRG ROM bank size.  

When set to 1, A14 from the NES is passed through to the ROM. 
When set to 0 however, A14 to the ROM is held LOW so that the lower
16K appears at both 8000-BFFFh and C000-FFFFh.  This allows the lower 16K
of a 32K bank to hold a 16K game.  The upper half of the same bank can
then hold another 16K game.  

M: Mirroring.  This is sorta odd due to the way it is controlled.

 00 - 1-screen mirroring
 01 - V mirroring
 10 - H mirroring
 11 - "3-screen" mirroring


In the following examples, A is the first nametable, and B is the second.

1-screen:

AA

V mirroring:

AB
AB

H mirroring:

AA
BB

"3-screen" (not really separate pages, but I have no better term):

AB
BB



That's it.
