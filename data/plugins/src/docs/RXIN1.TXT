NOTE: This mapper may be used on any cart with 16K PRG / 8K CHR banks,
and an increment-on-reset counter.  

This mapper has been assigned the designation BMC-ResetXin1 for the UNIF 
format. "X" is the number of games. If you must use ines, use mapper #60.  
(that's 60 decimal)


Nothing special.  2 ROMs and a counter.

There are no registers

Bank Select:

Every time reset is pressed, the counter increments.  A 4 in 1 for example
would have 2 bank select bits.  These would run to the upper 2 address lines
of the ROM.


That's it.
