This mapper has been assigned the designation BMC-T3H53 for the UNIF format.  
If you must use ines, use mapper #59.  (that's 59 decimal)


Generic NN in 1 multicart with 7-9 REAL games.

The hardware:

1 gloptopped Mapper/ROM chip.

Total PRG is 256K, and total CHR is 64K.  PRG is selected in 32K banks, and
CHR is selected in 8K banks.

-

Like some other multicarts, this one uses the address written to, rather 
than the data written.

A15      bit     A0

1xxx xxxS xPPP MCCC


P bits:  Selects one of the 8 32K PRG banks.
C bits:  Selects one of the 8 8K CHR banks.

M bit:   1=H mirroring, 0=V mirroring (need to check which)

x bits:  Not used

S bit:   This bit is weird.

0- Enable ROM at 8000-FFFFh.
1- Enable jumpers.

When the S bit is 0, the cart work as normal.  
When the S bit is 1, you can read the 2 jumpers on the cart.

Reading anywhere between 8000-FFFFh will read the jumper values- D0 and D1
will hold their state.  Since the ROM is switched out and the jumpers are 
switched in, you must read them from RAM.  

On startup, all bits are cleared- this selects PRG bank 0, CHR bank 0, and
ROM mode (as opposed to "jumper" mode).

That's it!
