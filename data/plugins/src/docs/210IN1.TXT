This mapper has been assigned the designation BMC-Generic210in1 for the UNIF 
format.


Yup.  Yet another multi.

The hardware:


1mbyte ROM, 8K VRAM, 74273, 7432, 7402, 74153, 7474, and a 74157.

Like alot of other multicarts, this one uses the address written to to select
the desired banks and other things.

-

Bank Select Register:


It uses A0 through A7.  This means the address written to matters, while
the actual data written does not.  

15      addr      0

1xxx xxGP TPPP PSMZ


OK, this is really weeeird.  As you can see, the program bank bits are
not all contiguous.  They are in order from lowest to highest, however.

This mapper has several modes.

--

Z: This is the PRG ROM size bit. 0=16K, 1=32K

G: This is the "default bank" bit. 0=lowest 16K, 1=highest 16K.

T: This is the "type" bit.  0=UNROM emulation, 1=NROM.

T = 0, Z = 0

In this mode, the first 16K is selected by writing to the P bits and the
S bit to select the bank.  The second bank is the same as the 
first, ANDed with 038h, then OR'd with either 00h (when the G bit is 0)
or 07h (when the G bit is 1)

T = 0, Z = 1

This is similar to the above, only the lower bank will be selected by
the P bits only, and then only the lower 16K of that 32K bank will appear
at the first 16K of PRG space.  The upper 16K operates the same as above.

T = 1, Z = 0

In this mode, both 16K sections of PRG will hold the same data.  Select
a bank using the P bits and the S bit.

T = 1, Z = 1

This is similar to the above, only now there is 1 32K PRG bank.  Use the
P bits only to select it.

M: Mirroring.  

0 selects H
1 selects V


That's it.
