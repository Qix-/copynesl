libcartctl version 0.02

raw cartridge ROM dumps into .nes and .unif format files usable by 
current nes emulators.

It may also be expanded to other related functionality, such as 
converting between file formats.

This library was created to support development of software for the 
CopyNES on new platforms and is designed to work well with the CopyNES.

A sample demonstrating usage can be found in the sample directory.
