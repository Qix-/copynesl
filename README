General introduction:
--------------------
The CopyNES is a tool for dumping and analyzing NES game cartridges. It can also be used as a development tool for testing software on the NES. 

The available software for the CopyNES is limited to Windows platforms, and it is the intent of the copynesl project to bring support for using the CopyNES to other platforms. 


Requirements:
-------------
This software communicates with the copynes through the libcopynes library and libcopynes is required in order to use any copynes specific features.  libcopynes uses the virtual com port drivers from FTDI and is implement using POSIX standards. copynesl is intended to be compatible with all systems for which a VCP driver is available and that comply with POSIX.  If you are attempting to use such a system and are encountering issues, please file a bug report at http://code.google.com/p/copynesl/

Instalation Notes:
------------------
See file INSTALL for detailed installation instructions.

	* Use configure --with-copynes[=DIR] to specify a non-standard location for libcopynes
	* You can use configure --without-copynes to compile without libcopynes support. 


Directory Structure:
--------------------
The source tree is organized:

	* copynesl: core program
	* settings: handles command line arguments, confile files, and default options
	* trk_log:  handles logging, tracing, and error message output for command line.
